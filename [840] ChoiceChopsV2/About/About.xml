    <name>XxHyde840xX's Choice Chops - Volume Two</name>
    <author>XxHyde840xX/Various</author>
	<url>https://github.com/XxHyde840xX/ChoiceChopsV2</url>
    <description>Another selection of choice items, carefully chopped from their respective mods. An exhaustive list is as follows;
	
	- [Animals And Reskins]
			- There a a good chunk of these, I'm not cross referencing for links. There's far too many and I just want to package them up.
			- This is one of those "I'm trimming my list without trimming my list," inclusions. Sorry folks!
			- I am not the original author of these and all credit goes to the original creators and artists who did the reskins.
			- Obviously incompatible with the original versions, so if you see any of the below animals or skins in your list, yeet 'em!
				
				- Milkrats / Tanuki / Rhodesian Ridgebacks / Pygmy Muffalo / Mamuffalo / Meat Pigs / Domestic Thrumbo / Coldwarg
				- Beefeaters / Muffaloaves / Boomaphants / Insect Meat Reskin / Another Milk Retexture - Re-Bagged! (I hackjobbed this one!)
				
			Additional Notes:
				
				- I've removed the glow comp from the Muffaloves. It was a stationary one that the plants use. It's better now.
				- I've also remove the patches for the "A Dog Said" mod as I don't use it. Sorry folks!
				
	- [Geometric Floors, More Floor Coverings, and Royal Carpets by JF]
			- Love the mods, hate the vRAM usage on startup. Seriously, everything needed downscaling. Even the icons.
			- 1024x1024 MAXIMUM for floor textures. Icons down to 128x128 because they were nice.
			- There were around 800-900 textures resized, and it's only around 100-ish MB or so now.
			- Don't want the decor? Deal with it. It's here, and I'm not downscaling it again if my files reset for some reason.
			- The carpets were honestly fine, but they're here too.
			
	- [JD's Simple Switch with Fixed Light Offsets]
			- I liked the switch. The lights were off. They are now where they should be. I didn't even notice the issue.
			- Big thanks to CaptainArbitrary in the RimWorld Discord Server for both alerting me to the problem, and having a fix.
			- All it was was just tweaked textures but it makes all the difference, especially once it was pointed out.
			- Enjoy the power switch! I know I do, the vanilla one is bland as hell.

	This marks the end of this particular modpack. I've learned alot along the way, and despite the quirks, incompatibilities, and
	dependencies, I think I did an alright job for my first outing at putting something together. My only, and biggest regret with
	this project is that I will not be able to release it publicly. I will be working on other packs like this in the future, as well
	as some sorely needed original content, but in the meantime, I hope you enjoy XxHyde840xX's Choice Chops. Stay Safe, and Have Fun.
