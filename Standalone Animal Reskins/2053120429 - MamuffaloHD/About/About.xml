I do love the Muffalo races! This is an old mod wrote by my friend Bacon Bits.

I like to keep the original color and as close to the original mod as possible.

Genetically engineered as part of a Prehistoric Revival Experiment, the Mamuffalo is a large herding herbivore and peaceful unless disturbed like it's cousin the Muffalo. While somewhat coarse, mamuffalo wool's long fibres make it very 
strong and provides very good insulation. Wool clothes can keep the body warm even in extreme conditions.</description>
